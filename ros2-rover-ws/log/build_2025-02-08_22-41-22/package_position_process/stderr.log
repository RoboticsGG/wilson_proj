[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:13 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findmsgs_ifaces.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "msgs_ifaces", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "msgs_ifaces" with
  any of the following names:

    msgs_ifacesConfig.cmake
    msgs_ifaces-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "msgs_ifaces" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "msgs_ifaces_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "msgs_ifaces" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
