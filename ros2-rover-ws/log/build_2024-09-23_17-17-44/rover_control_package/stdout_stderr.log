[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:10 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findrover_control_package.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH
  this project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided
  by "rover_control_package", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "rover_control_package" with any of the following names:

    rover_control_packageConfig.cmake
    rover_control_package-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "rover_control_package" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
  or set "rover_control_package_DIR" to a directory containing one of the
  above files.  If "rover_control_package" provides a separate development
  package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
